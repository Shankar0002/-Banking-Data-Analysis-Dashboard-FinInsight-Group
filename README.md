 This project is a comprehensive banking data analysis dashboard developed in Microsoft Power BI. It demonstrates real-world data modeling and visualization techniques by integrating multiple analytical modules into a cohesive reporting solution. The dashboard leverages advanced data transformations, DAX measures, and interactive visuals to provide detailed insights into banking operations, customer behavior, and overall financial performance.

## Project Overview
The dashboard is built using Power BI Desktop and encompasses a variety of analyses that answer critical business questions related to customer demographics, branch performance, transaction behavior, and risk assessment. The primary objectives of the dashboard include:

>> Customer and Account Analysis:
Evaluate account balances, transaction volumes, and risk metrics to segment customers, identify high-value segments, and recommend targeted financial products.

>> Branch Performance Assessment:
Analyze branch activity by measuring transaction counts and total transaction amounts. The dashboard highlights which branches are driving high volumes and high-value transactions, thus helping to optimize resource allocation and branch-level strategies.

>> Currency Standardization and Exchange Rate Impact:
To ensure consistency in reporting, all transactions are converted into a standardized currency. The impact of fluctuating exchange rates is analyzed, enabling better financial comparisons across different currencies.

>> Correlation Analyses:
Through scatter plots and trendline analyses, the dashboard examines the relationships between various key performance indicators – such as interest rates versus account balances, and credit scores versus loan amounts – to assess if and how these metrics correlate.

>> Time Series and Predictive Modeling:
Time series forecasting techniques (utilizing built-in Power BI forecasting features) are applied to historical transaction data to predict future trends. Additionally, a simple linear trend model predicts future account growth, assisting the bank in planning for demand and resource management.

>> Risk Assessment:
Using advanced DAX calculations, a risk assessment model was developed. This model combines factors like low credit scores, low balances, and low transaction activity into a composite risk score. Customers are then categorized into risk levels (No Risk, Low, Moderate, High), which can be used for proactive engagement and targeted customer support.

>> Demographic and Transaction Behavior Analysis:
The dashboard extracts key customer demographic details (such as employment sector, years at current residence, and city of residence) from semi-structured data fields. These are used to analyze and compare transaction behavior across different demographic segments, helping inform marketing strategies and customer relationship management.

>> Technical Methodologies
Data Transformation:
Power Query is used extensively to split and clean semi-structured fields (e.g., AccountHolderDetails) into separate columns. This transformation allows for precise filtering, grouping, and segmentation.

>> DAX Modeling:
Measures and calculated columns are created using DAX to compute summary statistics (such as total transaction counts, average balances, and risk scores), and to develop predictive models. Advanced functions like CALCULATE(), FILTER(), and DATEDIFF() form the core of our risk and forecasting models.

>> Interactive Visualization:
The dashboard contains a series of interactive visuals (scatter plots, bar charts, pie/donut charts, matrices, and card visuals) that allow users to drill down into the data. Smart narratives and dynamic titles enhance the user experience, making key insights readily accessible.

>> Insights and Applications
Branch Optimization:
By identifying branches with the highest activity and transaction values, the dashboard enables management to focus on optimizing resources and expanding high-performing locations.

>> Risk Management:
The risk model offers a clear segmentation of customer risk, aiding in proactive risk management and the customization of financial products such as credit facilities and loan offerings.

>> Customer Segmentation:
Demographic analyses allow for targeted marketing and customer engagement strategies, ensuring that different customer groups receive tailored services that meet their needs.

Conclusion
Overall, this Power BI dashboard serves as an end-to-end analytics solution for a banking institution, combining traditional business intelligence with advanced predictive analytics. It empowers stakeholders with actionable insights, supports data-driven decision-making, and establishes a solid foundation for ongoing performance monitoring and strategic planning.
